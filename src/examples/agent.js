/**
 * Agent Example
 * 
 * This example demonstrates how to use the Together API to create an agent. The agent can run commands and use tools.
 * 
 * This example also showcases "JSON Mode". It ensures the agent responds in a structured format.
 * 
 * ====================================================================================================================
 *                                                  ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
 * ====================================================================================================================
 * Allowing agents to run commands and use tools is a powerful feature, but it can also be very dangerous!
 * 
 * LLMs are prone to hallucinations and may make silly mistakes. Always be sure to carefully review the commands the
 * agent wants to run.
 * ====================================================================================================================
 * 
 * Example tasks:
 * - I have a README.md file in the current directory, I want a list of lines that contain the word "you". Please save the output to a file called output.txt. Then I would also like another copy of that file with line numbers, call it whatever you like.
 * - How many JavaScript files are there in this folder and all subfolders, excluding the "node_modules" directory?
